For a website focused on Naming and Name Matching, here are the core functions I recommend to make it engaging and useful.

1. Core Features (MVP)
These are the essential features to get the site running:

Smart Name Generator:
Filters: Generate names based on Gender, Origin/Culture (e.g., Celtic, Japanese), Meaning (e.g., "Strength", "Flower"), and Length.
"Surprise Me": A button for completely random, interesting suggestions.
Name Compatibility / Matching Score:
Input: Two names (e.g., Partners, Parent & Child, Siblings).
Algorithm: Calculate a "Harmony Score" based on:
Phonetics: Do they sound good together? (Rhythm, rhyme).
Numerology: (Optional fun factor) Calculating life path numbers.
Origin: Matching or complementary origins.
Name Dictionary:
Search for a specific name to see its Meaning, Origin, Pronunciation, and Popularity.
2. Advanced / "Wow" Features
To make the site stand out and feel premium:

AI Name Assistant: A chat interface where users can describe a "vibe" (e.g., "I want a name that sounds like a vintage French movie star") and get tailored suggestions.
Trending Charts: Visual graphs showing a name's popularity over the last 100 years (using real data like SSA).
"Sibling Harmony": Enter existing children's names, and the system suggests a new name that fits the "set" without being too similar.
Favorites List: Allow users to "Heart" names and see them in a shortlist to compare side-by-side.
3. Technical & Design Considerations
Vibrant, Emotional Design: Naming is emotional. The site should use soft, welcoming colors or a mystical/starry theme depending on the "vibe" (e.g., Numerology vs. Modern).
Shareable Results: When users get a "95% Match" score, generate a beautiful card they can download or share on social media.
Which direction appeals to you more?

Data-Driven: Focus on trends, history, and hard data.
Fun & Mystical: Focus on compatibility, numerology, and "vibes".
AI-Powered: Focus on the smart assistant and personalized recommendations.
